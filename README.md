# Project-Piscis

This project is an implementation of Craig Reynold's Boids program to simulate a behavior similar to a school of fish. The simulation will be written in C++ and simulated in a 3D space. The behavior of each of the fish or boid will be based on these principles :

●	Separation 

●	Alignment

●	Cohesion
